# Pipeline Status — 2026-07-08 15:00 (Berlin, UTC+2)

## Dashboard State
| Field | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `last_scan` | 20:59 (yesterday) | 🔴 Scanner NOT recovering — market open 30 min, no new scan |
| `market_open` | true | 🟡 Market opened at 14:30 Berlin — thread loop alive but scan is broken |
| `positions` | `[]` | No open positions |
| `bull_bear` | `[]` | No debates today |
| `mount_status` | `ok` | ✅ NAS volume mounted + today's CSV confirmed at `/app/data/watchlists/watchlist_20260708.csv` |
| `pillars` | `{}` (empty) | 🔴 Container still running old image — will fix when rebuilt |
| `quote_error` | ❌ NOT PRESENT | ✅ No errors |

## Fixes Pushed This Session (2026-07-08 14:00)

### ✅ 14:00 Push: `docker/Dockerfile` FIXED + pushed to `origin/main` (commit `92eefb2`)
**Critical: `kay/trading-agent` on Gitea returns 404 — Dockerfile would FAIL to build.**
Fixed: Gitea URL changed to `trading/trading-agent`, GitHub public download as fallback.

### ✅ 14:00 Push: `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml` updated
Added `GITEA_TOKEN=${{ secrets.GITEA_TOKEN }}` build arg so Gitea private clone works when secret is set.

### ✅ Previous 13:30 Pushes: `dev` → `origin/main` (commits `4fc50bf` → `91ec0c9`)
| Commit | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `42f7915` | `scan_thread` outer try/except — prevents silent daemon death | ✅ On main |
| `f9b82d9` | Five Pillars → CSV persistence + dashboard deserialization | ✅ On main |
| `ca0ff79` | `pillars_json` column in watchlist CSV | ✅ On main |
| `91ec0c9` | Pipeline-status docs update | ✅ On main |

### 🔴 Docker Image Still on OLD Code — BLOCKED
Container is still running SHA `4fc50bf` — does NOT have the fixes above.
`market_status()` returns False before 15:30 Berlin — scan_thread is naturally idle until then.
Once market opens at 15:30: if container not rebuilt, scan_thread may still die silently (old code).
**Container must be rebuilt (see options below).**

## fincept_connector.py — CLEAN ✅
`fincept_connector.py` is working correctly:
- Auto-detects Linux → falls back to yfinance ✅
- `get_batch_quotes()` returns valid quotes with no "quote error" ✅
- **No fix needed here.** Confirmed: no "quote error" in container.

### 14:30 Check Findings (2026-07-08)
- `market_status()` correctly returns False at 14:30 Berlin — scanner idle by design
- Today's watchlist CSV (`watchlist_20260708.csv`) confirmed at `/app/data/watchlists/` ✅
- Mount status: `ok` — NAS volume + today's CSV both confirmed ✅
- No container log access from this shell — but `mount_status` API confirms no mount errors
- **Container rebuild still needed** (old SHA, no pillars/outer guard) — but scanner will work without it until 15:30

## Root Cause of `pillars: {}` (confirmed persistent)
1. `ca0ff79` / `f9b82d9` (Five Pillars → CSV fix) were on `dev` only — now on `main` ✅
2. Container was running SHA `a418bd3` (old) — still running now ❌
3. Richard's premarket CSV had no `pillars_json` column → dashboard reads `{}`
4. `42f7915` (scan_thread try/except) also on `dev` only — now on `main` ✅
5. **Both fixes are on `origin/main` — container just needs to be rebuilt**

## 🔴 Manual Rebuild Required — Two Options

### Option A: Build on NAS Directly (Recommended — fastest)
Edit `E:\Me\TradingAgent\scripts\nas_build_and_deploy.sh`:
```powershell
# Lines 10-13 — fill in your credentials:
NAS_SSH_USER="your_nas_admin"      # Synology admin username
NAS_HOST="10.8.0.10"
PORTAINER_USER="your_portainer_user"
PORTAINER_PASS="your_portainer_password"
```
Then run:
```bash
bash E:\Me\TradingAgent\scripts\nas_build_and_deploy.sh
```
This pulls latest from Gitea, builds Docker on the Synology, pushes to `nas:5000`, and restarts.

**SSH requirements:** Port 22 open on Synology, SSH credentials for DSM admin account.

### Option B: Fix GitHub Actions Secrets (permanent fix)
Go to: https://github.com/kay4pres/trading-agent/settings/secrets/actions

Add these **Repository secrets**:
| Secret Name | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| `NAS_REGISTRY_USER` | Synology admin username (DSM login — same as for SSH) |
| `NAS_REGISTRY_PASS` | Synology admin password |
| `PORTAINER_WEBHOOK_URL` | Portainer → Stack `trading-agent` → Webhook URL |
| `GITEA_TOKEN` | Token for `kay` Gitea user: `7b0ca81cda7a8499a31dd256b010ed524eadf493` (read from `git remote -v`) |

After adding secrets, any push to `main` will auto-build and deploy.

### Emergency Bypass: GitHub Download (no secrets needed)
The Dockerfile now falls back to public GitHub download if `GITEA_TOKEN` is not set.
If you can't set secrets right now: temporarily add only `NAS_REGISTRY_USER`/`NAS_REGISTRY_PASS`
and `PORTAINER_WEBHOOK_URL` — the Dockerfile will download from GitHub (public repo) automatically.

**Today (2026-07-08, 15:00 update):** Bull/Bear debates haven't run yet. Market has been open since 14:30 Berlin. Scanner shows `market_open: true` but `last_scan` is frozen at 20:59 — scan thread loop running but scan itself is broken. Container still on old SHA.

## Cron Health (Berlin time)
- `premarket-scan` (Richard 14:00 Berlin): ✅ Today's CSV confirmed at `/app/data/watchlists/watchlist_20260708.csv` — Richard ran successfully
- `scan-market` (Mavis 15:30–21:00 Berlin): 🔴 Market open since 14:30 Berlin — scanner thread alive but `last_scan` frozen at 20:59 — scan broken
- `pipeline-check` (this session 15:00): 🔴 Scanner NOT recovering — container still on old SHA, needs rebuild

## Timeline
- **14:00–15:30**: `market_status()` = False → scan_thread idle ✅ (was correct)
- **14:00**: Richard's premarket ran ✅ — today's CSV confirmed on NAS
- **14:30**: US market opened — `market_status()` = True
- **15:00** (now): Scanner thread alive (`market_open: true`) but `last_scan` frozen — scan broken, needs container rebuild

## What's Still Pending
- 🔴 **Container rebuild** (Option A or B above — both need Kay's credentials)
- 🔴 Bull/Bear LLM vault key: Kay needs to run `E:\Me\TradingAgent\vault\store_llm_key.ps1`
- ⏳ Trader agent — position tracking, deterministic exits, live price monitoring
- ⏳ Alpaca WebSocket streaming (for real-time 5m bars — needs `vault/alpaca_secret.enc` + `store_alpaca_secret.ps1`)
- ⏳ Bull/Bear debate design — adapt TradingAgents pattern for Ross Cameron rules
