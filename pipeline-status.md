## Root Causes Found (this session)

### 🔴 `bull_bear: []` — TWO problems

**Problem 1: Container crontab used `python` not `python3`**
- `entrypoint.py` crontab entries called `python premarket_screener.py` and `python -m scripts.scan_market_bull_bear`
- Container has `python3` but no `python` symlink → "python: not found" in all logs
- Confirmed in container logs: `scan.log` = 2362 bytes of only `/bin/sh: 1: python: not found (×25)`
- **Fix pushed**: Removed Bull/Bear entries from `entrypoint.py` crontab entirely (Mavis runs Bull/Bear inline)
- Also fixed `python` → `python3` for remaining `premarket_screener.py` entry

**Problem 2: Bull/Bear NOT integrated into cron scan pipeline**
- Bull/Bear only ran on streaming events (Alpaca WebSocket) — WebSocket not connected → no events
- Container `live_loop.log` shows: "No watchlist found" + help text (loop dying/restarting repeatedly)
- The Mavis `scan-market` cron DOES call `scan_market_bull_bear.py` — but it needs fixes:
  - `_llm()` tried Kay's Windows `llm_call.py` path (wrong in Mavis cron context)
  - Fell back to `_llm_direct()` which needed vault DPAPI key
  - Bull/Bear script had no access to Docker volume UNC path
- **Fixes pushed** (`scripts/scan_market_bull_bear.py`):
  1. `_llm()`: Added Mavis daemon LLM via IPC socket (port 15321) — primary path
  2. `_llm()`: Added vault `MINIMAX_API_KEY` env var — Docker container vault
  3. `DATA_DIR`: Now auto-detects Docker volume UNC `\\10.8.0.10\Docker\data` first
  4. Writes Bull/Bear results to both Docker volume AND local `E:\Me\TradingAgent\data`
  5. Reads existing results from either location

**Root cause chain**: `entrypoint.py` crontab `python` → fail → Bull/Bear never called → `bull_bear_results.json` never written → `bull_bear: []`

### 🔴 `pillars: {}` — live scoring fails for penny stocks

**Root cause**: `get_batch_quotes()` returns empty for all 7 symbols → no live quotes → no pillar scores

These are nano/micro-cap penny stocks (TVTD $3, TDTH $2.56, EDHL $4.94, CRE $3.28). yfinance returns empty or stale data for these during market hours.

- `run_scan()` in `app.py` falls back to `premarket_csv` source when `get_batch_quotes()` fails
- All 7 signals fell through to `source: "premarket_csv"` with `pillars: {}`

**Fix pushed** (`dashboard/app.py`):
- Added CSV-data fallback scoring: computes P1 (price), P2 (gap), P3 (rel_vol), P5 (float) directly from CSV fields
- P4 (catalyst) uses CSV's existing `p4_catalyst` or defaults to 0.5
- Signals now get proper `pillars: {P1_price, P2_gap, P3_relvol, P4_catalyst, P5_float}` even when live quotes fail
- `source` field changed to `csv_fallback` to indicate CSV-based scoring

## Fixes Pushed This Session (2026-07-08 15:30)

### ✅ `entrypoint.py` — FIXED + pushed
- Removed broken Bull/Bear crontab entries (Mavis runs Bull/Bear inline in its own session)
- Fixed `python` → `python3` for remaining `premarket_screener.py` entry
- Only two crontab entries remain: `premarket_screener.py` + `process_new_chapters.py`

### ✅ `dashboard/app.py` — FIXED
- Added CSV-data fallback scoring (lines ~542-595): computes P1-P5 from CSV fields when live quotes fail
- Added `signals_live.json` write after each scan: enables Bull/Bear runner to pick up cron scan results
- Bull/Bear can now read `signals_live.json` as primary input (was only written by streaming pipeline)

### ✅ `scripts/scan_market_bull_bear.py` — FIXED
- `_llm()`: Added Mavis daemon IPC socket call (port 15321) as primary LLM path
- `_llm()`: Added `MINIMAX_API_KEY` env var (Docker vault) as fallback
- `_llm_direct()`: Now checks `MINIMAX_API_KEY` env var first, then Kay's vault
- `DATA_DIR`: Auto-detects Docker volume UNC `\\10.8.0.10\Docker\data` first
- Results written to both Docker volume AND local `E:\Me\TradingAgent\data`
- Reads existing Bull/Bear results from either location (graceful fallback)
- Reads `signals_live.json` from both Docker volume AND local path

## Bull/Bear Pipeline — Now Integrated with Cron

**Before (broken)**:
- Bull/Bear ONLY ran on streaming events (Alpaca WebSocket) → no WebSocket → no Bull/Bear
- `bull_bear_results.json` never written → dashboard always shows `[]`

**After (fixed)**:
- Mavis `scan-market` cron runs every 30 min (15:30, 16:00, 16:30...) during market hours
- Cron calls `scan_market_bull_bear.py` after checking dashboard state
- Bull/Bear reads `signals_live.json` (written by container scan_thread every 60s)
- Bull/Bear writes to `bull_bear_results.json` in Docker volume
- Dashboard reads `bull_bear_results.json` → shows Bull/Bear verdicts

**LLM availability (3-tier fallback)**:
1. Mavis daemon IPC socket (port 15321) — works when Mavis daemon is on same host
2. `MINIMAX_API_KEY` env var — set in Docker container vault
3. Kay's vault `llm_api_key.enc` — DPAPI-encrypted, accessible on Kay's local machine

## NAS / Docker Volume Status
- Docker volume: `\\10.8.0.10\Docker\data` ✅ (confirmed accessible from Kay's host)
- Today's watchlist CSV: `watchlist_20260708.csv` ✅ (written 14:01 Berlin)
- Richard's Z: share sync: ✅ (watchlist to Docker volume UNC works)
- `bull_bear_results.json`: Not yet written (Bull/Bear needs container rebuild + Mavis cron next run)

## Cron Health (Berlin time)
- `premarket-scan` (Mavis 04:00 UTC / 06:00 Berlin): ✅ Yesterday ran, today's at 06:00 Berlin
- `scan-market` (Mavis every 30 min 15:30-20:00 Berlin): ✅ Scanner alive at 15:30
  - Bull/Bear integration: ✅ Fixed in Bull/Bear runner, Mavis cron will call it next run
- `pipeline-check` (Mavis 15:00, 15:30 Berlin): ✅ This session
- `transcription-sprint` (Mavis 21:00 Berlin): ⏳ Runs tonight after market close

## What's Still Pending

### 🔴 Container rebuild needed (to pick up all fixes)
The container is running an older image. Fixes in this session:
- `entrypoint.py`: Bull/Bear crontab removed
- `app.py`: CSV fallback + signals_live.json write
- Bull/Bear runner: Mavis daemon LLM + Docker volume support

**Rebuild triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch → GitHub Actions builds + Portainer webhook (if secrets set)
- Manual: NAS build script `nas_build_and_deploy.sh`
- Emergency: Portainer "Rebuild" button on the stack

### 🔴 Bull/Bear vault key
- Bull/Bear runner tries Mavis daemon IPC first (no key needed) ✅
- If daemon IPC fails, falls back to `MINIMAX_API_KEY` env var (Docker vault) ✅
- Kay's vault key (`vault/llm_api_key.enc`) as final fallback ✅
- LLM should work without any manual key setup ✅

### 🔴 Richard premarket at 06:00 Berlin
- Pipeline notes show Richard should run at 6:00 AM Berlin (not 14:00)
- Currently: `premarket-scan` cron at 04:00 UTC = 06:00 Berlin ✅
- But Richard's watchlist for TODAY is from 14:00 cron, not 06:00
- Today's watchlist (20260708) written at 14:01 Berlin → US market opens at 14:30 Berlin
- 06:00 Berlin run would create watchlist for NEXT trading day
- Current setup (14:00 Berlin premarket) is correct for US day trading ✅

### ⏳ Alpaca WebSocket streaming
- `live_loop.log` shows "No watchlist found" — loop dying and restarting repeatedly
- Root cause: Python not found OR watchlist not in expected path
- The live streaming pipeline is separate from cron pipeline
- Once Bull/Bear is working via cron, streaming is a nice-to-have (not blocking)

### ⏳ Trader agent — position tracking, deterministic exits
- `positions.json` exists but `positions: []` in dashboard
- No open positions today
- Pipeline still needs Trader agent build

## Architecture Summary

```
Mavis scan-market cron (15:30-20:00 every 30 min)
  └─ Calls scan_market_bull_bear.py (Mavis LLM inline)
       ├─ Reads signals_live.json ← written by container scan_thread
       ├─ Bull/Bear/Research Manager debate (Mavis daemon LLM)
       └─ Writes bull_bear_results.json → Dashboard reads it

Container scan_thread (every 60s during market hours)
  ├─ Reads watchlist CSV from Docker volume (Richard's premarket)
  ├─ Live Five Pillars scoring (yfinance)
  │    └─ Falls back to CSV-data scoring (FIXED this session)
  ├─ Writes signals to signals_live.json (FIXED this session)
  ├─ Updates dashboard state (port 5050)
  └─ No Bull/Bear (only streaming event triggers it)
